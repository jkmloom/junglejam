# JungleJam 🌿

**JungleJam** is a mindful social media platform designed to make people digitally social **without encouraging overuse**.
It works *alongside* existing platforms instead of competing with them, helping users consume content intentionally rather than endlessly.

The internet today is a jungle of content. JungleJam helps users navigate it consciously.

## 🚀 Project Vision

Modern social media platforms are optimized for engagement, not well-being.
JungleJam aims to:

* Encourage **intentional content consumption**
* Reduce **doomscrolling and overuse**
* Provide a **simple, distraction-free social experience**
* Act as a **companion platform** to existing social media services

---

## 🧠 Core Idea

JungleJam does **not replace** platforms like YouTube or Instagram.
Instead, it:

* Aggregates **public content** (where allowed) from external platforms
* Allows users to post and interact on JungleJam’s **own native platform**
* Focuses on **minimal UI and controlled usage**, not infinite scrolling

---

* 🔍 **Unified Search**
  Search content from JungleJam and supported public external sources.

* ▶️ **YouTube Integration**
  Discover and watch YouTube videos using the official YouTube API.

* 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 **Native Social Feed**
  Post images and videos directly on JungleJam.

* 🕶️ **Anonymous Mode**

  * No account history

* ⏱️ **Mindful Usage Design**
  Features are intentionally designed to discourage overuse.

## 🎨 UI Philosophy

* Simple and clean interface
